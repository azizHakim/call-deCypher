# RAG application for analyzing call logs

It takes in multiple call logs as text file and a question about the calls. The call logs are then extracted and indexed in a vector store with langchain. Then necessary facts are retreived according to the question. We have combined two chains: `facts_chain` extracts the necessary facts and finally `refine_facts_chain` return the answer by removing unnecessary facts.
